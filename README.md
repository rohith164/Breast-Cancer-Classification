# Breast-Cancer-Classification
This repository aimed at designing a Machine Learning Model for Classification of tumors as Benign and Malignant based on the tumor shape and its geometry. It is aimed to predict the tumor type using the advanced supervised technology. It helps to enable use of precision medicine in clinical treatment of breast cancer. The purpose of choosing this as my project is to benefit the medical field. 
Building a model which accurately classifies tumors as Benign or Malignant based on the tumor shape and its geometry.
The features of the dataset include:
1.tumor radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2.texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3.perimeter
4.area
5.smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6.compactness (perimeter² / area — 1.0)
7.concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8.concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9.symmetry
10.fractal dimension
The mean, standard error and “worst” or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features.
